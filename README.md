# Retail-Store-Shrinkage
📌 Project Overview

Shrinkage in retail stores refers to the loss of inventory due to theft, fraud, damage, or administrative errors. This project aims to analyze shrinkage patterns and predict potential losses using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help retail businesses identify high-risk areas and take preventive measures.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes:

Store Information: Location, size, employee count

Inventory Data: Stock levels, turnover rates

Sales Data: Daily/weekly revenue, discounts

Loss Reports: Missing inventory, theft reports, damaged goods

🎯 Objectives

Build a predictive model using logistic regression to classify high-risk stores

Perform data preprocessing, handling missing values and outliers

Feature engineering to extract insights from raw data

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

🔧 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing

Scikit-Learn for machine learning

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Jupyter Notebook for development

🏗️ Project Workflow

Data Collection: Gather and clean retail shrinkage data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify patterns in shrinkage

Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features

Model Training & Evaluation: Train logistic regression and test performance

Deployment & Insights: Provide recommendations to reduce shrinkage

🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/nishantmishra2003/Retail-Shrinkage-Analysis.git
cd Retail-Shrinkage-Analysis

📈 Results

Stores with high employee turnover show higher shrinkage rates

Certain product categories are more prone to theft and damage

Predictive model achieves X% accuracy in identifying high-risk stores

📝 Future Enhancements

Improve model accuracy using neural networks

Integrate real-time shrinkage monitoring

Expand dataset with external factors like economic trends and seasonality
